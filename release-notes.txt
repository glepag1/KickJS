KickJS Release notes:

0.5.0
- Now all classes must be loaded using require.js (this replaces the KICK.namespace method).
- kick.math is now based on gl-matrix 2.0 (note that parameters has different ordering - and out parameter is required)
- Changed class names in math module to start with uppercase (e.g. from vec3 to Vec3)
- Changed outer module to lowercase (was KICK is now kick)
- Introduced static reference (singleton) to engine. The engine can be referenced through the static field
  kick.core.Engine.instance (internally KickJS uses a private EngineSingleton class). Note that this has removed the
  engine parameter from a lot of functions.
- kick.core.ResourceTracker is now used very different - now mainly used internally when loading projects
